# Laravel Data Package

## Why This Step
Spatie's [Laravel-Data](https://spatie.be/docs/laravel-data/v4/introduction) package provides a powerful way to create data transfer objects (DTOs) with built-in validation, transformation, and type safety. This reduces boilerplate code and improves data handling consistency across your application.

## What It Does
- Installs the Laravel Data package for creating structured data objects
- Enables automatic validation and transformation of incoming data
- Provides type-safe data transfer objects for API responses and form handling
- Integrates seamlessly with Laravel's validation and serialization systems

## Implementation

### Install Laravel Data Package
```bash
sail composer require spatie/laravel-data
```

The package will be automatically registered through LaraAcvel's package discovery, making it immediately available for use in your application.
