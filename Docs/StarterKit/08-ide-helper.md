# Laravel IDE Helper

## Why This Step
Laravel IDE Helper enhances IDE autocompletion and static analysis by generating helper files that provide type information for Laravel's dynamic features like facades, models, and container bindings.

## What It Does
- Generates PhpDoc annotations for Laravel facades
- Creates IDE helper files for better autocompletion
- Provides model property hints based on database schema
- Improves static analysis and reduces IDE warnings

## Implementation

### Install Laravel IDE Helper
```bash
sail composer require --dev barryvdh/laravel-ide-helper
```

The package will automatically register itself through Laravel's package discovery and is ready to use for generating IDE helper files.
